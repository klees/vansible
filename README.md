# VANSIBLE
**The aim of this project is to provide developers with a fast and uncomplicated development environment.**
**For this, Vagrant and Ansible will be used in combination to provide various virtual machines with different software.**
**The developers should be able to do all settings via a central configuration file.**

## Usage
### Software Requirements
* Linux or MacOs
* [Vagrant]
* [Ansible]
* [VirtualBox]
* [git]
* [python2.7]

### Installation
```
$ cd DESTINATION_FOLDER
$ git clone https://github.com/daniwe4/vansible.git
$ cd Vansible
```
### Configuration
All configuration tasks can be done in one file. Open the file "goup_vars/all/config.yml".
Each section is well commentet. Feel free to update each section for your own needs.

### First Start
The first start has to be with root priviliges. It will create a symlink, so from now on you only need the command "vag".
```
$ sudo ./vag.py
```

### Next Starts
Start or Install machines:
```
$ vag up [machinename]
```
Stop machines:
````
$ vag stop [machinename]
````
Update machines:
````
$ vag provision [machinename]
````
Destroy machines:
````
$ vag destroy [machinename]
````

### Access To The Machine

To access to the console of the virtual machine you can use the following command:
````
$ vag ssh [machinename]
````

### Mount a vm
To access the folder structure of the virtual machines i suggest to use sshfs.
You also can use the script in the repo to mount a vm by its name.

````
$ sshfs root@<vm_ip_address>:/home/ <mount_dir_on_host>
````
or use the script
````
$ ./mountvm.sh <vm name>
````

The script will create a folder in your home directory called mount. In the mount folder you will find a folder with your vm name. All files you store here will be saved on the vm.
